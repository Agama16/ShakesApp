App Development Project-creating an online shakes shop

This project is a shakes buisness website, that was ment to sell products online, and post information about the stores.

The customer side:
the customer needs an account in the website in order to order products.
the customer can add products to his cart, and buy the products in the cart.
the customer can add products to "favorites" where he can save products but not on his cart, the purpose of this function is that a customer can save products for future buys.
the customer can filter products by type,price and points, the purpose of "points" is to measure from 1-5 how healthy a shake is, 1-being the least healthy and 5- being the most healthy.
to find products that fit the filter the customer has to input data for all 3 criterions.
the customer can see all the branches of the stores. and find by place.
the customer can see the weather of where he currently is.

The manager side:
the manager can see list of all the other workers.
the manager can add a new worker.
the manager can create a new product.
the manager can filter workers by salary,rank and branch id, all 3 inputs should be given in order to filter the workers.
the manager can add a new branch of the store.
the manager can see stats of how many times an item was added to cart by customers.

notes:
the google API key session is expired, which is why the map isn't working.
